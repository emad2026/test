Hello,
My name is [Mohamed Emad], and I am a backend developer specializing in building robust and scalable systems using the Django framework with Python. I am currently working on the Delevendor project, a delivery application designed to provide professional and fast delivery services to customers while focusing on efficient management of orders, drivers, and service areas.

My role in the project includes:

Developing a RESTful API using Django to power the application's backend functionalities.
Designing and maintaining the database structure to ensure secure and organized data storage.
Implementing best practices for performance, security, and data management to ensure system stability.
Working on key features of the application such as:
Order management (adding, updating, and tracking order statuses).
Driver management (adding, removing, or updating driver details).
Area management with customizable delivery fees for each location.
Providing performance analytics, including statistics on orders, drivers, and revenue.
My goal is to ensure that Delevendor operates efficiently, meeting user needs seamlessly and securely.
